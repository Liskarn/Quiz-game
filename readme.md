# Quiz-Game.

A small game made with simple html,css and javascript that anyone can use. The game is made up of two HTML pages one for the start page and one for the game. Some simple CSS nothing super fancy to give it a little bit of a more apealing design. Simple javascript. that takes the question from the already created array with questions and displays them correctly, And some nice user feedback with buttons getting diabled and disapearing when no availible. Aswell as changin color on hover and if the answer is correct or wrong. At the moment the game only has 4 questions related to movies but hopefully i will have time in the future to add more.
